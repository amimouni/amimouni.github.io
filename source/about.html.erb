          <h2>Stimulating</h2>
          <p>
            We look for friendly and curious people who enjoy working and want to get better at what they do. Ask questions and seek answers. Tackle new challenges and make new discoveries. Never stop exploring.

          <p>
            It's rare to have such a large, uninterrupted chunk of time to focus on just one thing. Even at work, most of us have multiple responsibilities and priorities to juggle with. Here is a good place to start a project, and test it with the community.
