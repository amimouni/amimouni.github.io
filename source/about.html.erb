          <h2>Stimulating</h2>
          <p>
            We are looking for friendly and curious people who enjoy working and want to get better at what they do. People who ask questions and seek answers. People who are comfortable tackling new challenges and making new discoveries. People who never stop exploring.

            We value intrinsic motivation and self-direction. We believe people learn best when they're free to explore their passions and interests.

          <h2>Focus</h2>
          <p>
            It's rare to have such a large, uninterrupted chunk of time to focus on just one thing. At work or not, most of us have multiple responsibilities and priorities to juggle. This is a good place to start a project and test it with the community..

          <h2>Open the door</h2>
