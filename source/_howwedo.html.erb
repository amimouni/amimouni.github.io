          <p>
            We look for friendly, self-directed and curious people who enjoy working and want to get better at what they do.

          <h3>Thoughtful</h3>
          <p>
            The atmosphere here is friendly and intellectual.
            We have social rules. We like profound respect for each individual as a person and learner. We like asking questions in an environment that is not just productive but also supportive, friendly, and positive.

          <h3>Focus</h3>
          <p>
            It's rare to have such a large, uninterrupted chunk of time to focus on just one thing. Even at work, most of us have multiple responsibilities and priorities to juggle. Here is a good place to start a project, and test it with the community.

          <h3>Accessible</h3>
          <p>
            We're trying to keep the price accessible for everyone. There is shared rooms for those who have a smaller wallet and private room for those who needs to keep their privacy.
